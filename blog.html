        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>A design system can be very complex and specific. Just look to <a href="https://material.io"
            target="blank">material.io</a> for an example of a professional and comprehensive design system.</p>
        <p>While it is possible to create, or work off of a design system like this. You can also create a simpler
          design system to guide your design process. This approach works well with css frameworks such as <a
            href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">bootstrap</a> or <a href="https://" tailwindcss.com"
            target="_blank">tailwind</a>.</p>

        <h3>Creating a design library</h3>
        <p>You can create a design library in figma and penpot. This is really useful for planning the look and feel of
          a website.</p>
        <p>A design library can be shared with other designers and developers. It can also be used to export css styles.

        <h3>Setting up a color palette</h3>
        <p>Color palletes are very easy to make in both figma and penpot</p>
        <p>In figma, there is a <strong>+</strong> next to the color tool in the right panel. You can select this and
          add to styles.</p>
        <p>In penpot, you will do most of this in the assets tab.</p>
